[PM²](https://europa.eu/pm2/home_en) (pronounced “P-M squared”) is a Project Management Methodology developed by the European Commission.

## Introduction

The PM² Methodology is the official project management methodology of the EC and is currently being rapidly adopted internationally. It is a lean and easy to implement methodology suitable for any type of project as it enables project teams to manage projects effectively and deliver solutions and beneﬁts to their organisations and stakeholders. PM² enables Project Managers to deliver solutions and beneﬁts to their organisations through the effective management of project work. It is based on operational experience from projects run within the European Institutions, but also incorporates elements from a wide range of globally accepted project management best practices, standards and methodologies such as [PMBoK Guide](https://www.pmi.org/pmbok-guide-standards), [PRINCE2®](https://www.prince2.com/eur), [IPMA-ICB](https://www.ipma.world/).
